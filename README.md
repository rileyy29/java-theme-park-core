Part of a java plugin that I created for "Pixeltects" in 2018. A minecraft theme park server which welcomed a 1,000+ unique players.
Local server core plugin that integrates cross server functionality (redis), player profile storage (mongodb) as well as theme park related tools such as Flatrides (using vectors and velocity) and show tools (fountains, spotlights, etc).
